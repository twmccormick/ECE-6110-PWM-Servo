# ECE 6110 PWM Servo 
 
 ECE 6110 - Tyler McCormick - Extentsion 

 This code simply creates a PWM signal with a period of 20ms and simply changes the duty cycle from 5% to 10% back and forth with a small delay in bettwen each change.
 
 This generated PWM signal is then attached to one of the pins of the development board, which is then connected to a small servo as the signal wire.
